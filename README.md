1. Firebase Realtime Database
Purpose: Stores user data securely, such as workout logs, health metrics, and goals.
Usage:
User authentication (email/Google Sign-In).
Data persistence for workouts, goals, and nutrition logs.
Working:
When users log activities or set goals, the data is sent to Firebase and retrieved dynamically for real-time updates in the app.
2. RecyclerView
Purpose: Displays lists of dynamic data, such as workout logs and meal records.
Usage:
Used for showing a list of recorded workouts or meals.
Provides smooth scrolling and customization with custom ViewHolders.
Working:
Data fetched from Firebase is passed to an adapter, which populates the RecyclerView with user-specific entries.
3. MPAndroidChart
Purpose: Visualizes data trends through graphs and charts (e.g., calorie trends, progress bars).
Usage:
Creates bar charts and line graphs to track progress in metrics like weight, hydration, and calories.
Working:
The app feeds user data to the library to generate interactive and visually appealing graphs dynamically.
4. Material Design Components
Purpose: Provides pre-built UI components for a clean and modern app interface.
Usage:
Buttons, TextInputLayouts, Navigation Bar, and Snackbars are implemented for consistent user interaction.
Working:
These components adapt to dark and light mode settings, ensuring a seamless user experience.
5. Navigation Component
Purpose: Handles smooth navigation between different sections of the app (e.g., Workouts, Nutrition, Goals).
Usage:
Manages the appâ€™s fragments, including transitions and back-stack management.
Working:
Each section is represented as a fragment, and the Navigation Component ensures users can switch between them effortlessly.
6. SharedPreferences
Purpose: Stores small bits of user data locally, such as reminder settings or last-used preferences.
Usage:
Retains app settings like notifications and theme preferences even after app restarts.
Working:
The app retrieves these preferences on launch to personalize the experience for each user.
7. Geocoder API (Optional)
Purpose: Converts location inputs into addresses for fitness activity logs (e.g., workout location).
Usage:
Used in tracking or associating outdoor workout activities with locations.
Working:
Takes user input or GPS data and resolves it to a human-readable address in real-time.
How It Works
Data Flow:

User inputs are validated and stored in Firebase or displayed immediately via RecyclerView or other UI components.
Real-time updates ensure seamless synchronization between user actions and the displayed content.
Goal Progress Tracking:

The app calculates progress based on inputs like steps, calories, or water intake.
Progress bars and charts are updated dynamically to reflect achievements.
Health Metrics and Visualization:

Metrics like weight or BMI are logged by the user and processed to display trends through MPAndroidChart.
User Navigation:

The Navigation Component handles user transitions between the main features (Workouts, Nutrition, Goals, and Reports).
